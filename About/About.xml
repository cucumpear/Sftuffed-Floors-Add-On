  <description>Add-On for Fluffy's Stuffed Floors, which is of course required, as is Architect Sense.
  This mod adds a 2x2 tile floor, two overlays for chequerboard floors and adds a stuffed version of the new vanilla tiles and flagstones. More overlays are planned, all textures are either derived from the game itself or from Telkir's More Floors.
